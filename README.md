# Weekling Hunt

Weekling Hunt is a simple game concept I am using to develop my skills in pygame and programming in general. 
I am also teaching myself how to use git an github for this project.
I originally created this game as a text based game. This is a 2d version made using pygame

# How To Play

The object of the game is to have as much gold as possible by the end of the week. There are 7 days in the week(Sunday-Saturday) 
and 4 times of day(Morning, Mid-day, Evening, Night) where actions can be taken.
Earn gold by defeating enemies in battle. The tougher the enemy, the more gold you earn.
Tougher enemies come out in the evening with the toughest enemies coming out at night.
You can spend your gold on training your skills to defeat more difficult enemies.
Training costs more gold as you increase your stats. Sleep to fully heal your health. 
Sleeping always brings you to the next morning regardless of what time of day it is.

# Stats
There are 3 stats that you can increase on your character: Strength, Agility, and Accuracy

Strength is the maximum damage than you can do

Agility determines first strike and dodge chance

Accuracy affects chance to hit and chance to deal maximum damage

# Enemies
Enemies are generated from the csv file found in the data folder.
